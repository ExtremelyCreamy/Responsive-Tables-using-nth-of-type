h1. Responsive tables using nth-of-type and a jQuery version not using nth-of-type

There are two tables. One using all CSS and the nth-of-type selector.

The jQuery version loops through the table and duplicates the th text and prepends to the columns. I wrapped them in span tags so I could style them.
